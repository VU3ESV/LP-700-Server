# LP-700 Server

WebSocket bridge for the **Telepost LP-500 / LP-700 Digital Station Monitor**.
One server owns the meter's USB HID handle; many clients (browsers, phones,
logging PCs) get live telemetry and can issue control verbs, with every
client kept in sync.

Companion of [VU3ESV/LP-100A-Server](https://github.com/VU3ESV/LP-100A-Server).
Same fan-out semantics, same WebSocket frame shape, same Pi-first deployment
story — HID instead of serial.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
for the LP-500/700 USB HID protocol reference.

## Quick start (development, on a Mac)

```sh
go mod tidy
go test ./...
go run . -backend simulator -config deploy/config.example.toml
# open http://localhost:8089/
```

The reference web client is embedded in the binary — no separate frontend
build step.

## Building for the Raspberry Pi

```sh
./deploy/build-pi.sh                  # arm64 (Pi 3/4/5 with 64-bit OS)
ARCH=arm ./deploy/build-pi.sh         # ARMv7 (Pi Zero/1, 32-bit)
```

Pure Go (`/dev/hidraw` + sysfs on Linux), so no CGO toolchain is needed —
`GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build` works with whatever Go you have.

## Deploying on the Raspberry Pi

```sh
./deploy/redeploy.sh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

Self-bootstrapping: on a fresh Pi `redeploy.sh` creates the `lp700` system
user, installs the systemd unit + udev rule + default config, enables and
starts the service, and runs a `/healthz` check. Subsequent runs only push
the binary unless `--service` or `--keep-config` are explicitly used. SSH
multiplexing means you authenticate once per redeploy and `ssh -t` lets
sudo prompt interactively (or, with passwordless sudo, the deploy is silent).

```sh
./deploy/redeploy.sh pi@host --service       # also reinstall systemd unit
./deploy/redeploy.sh pi@host --keep-config   # binary only (skip toml/udev)
./deploy/redeploy.sh pi@host --restart-only  # bounce service only
ARCH=arm ./deploy/redeploy.sh pi@host        # 32-bit ARMv7 target
```

After install, confirm:

```sh
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
systemctl status lp700-server
journalctl -u lp700-server -f
curl http://raspberrypi.local:8089/healthz
```

The udev rule matches the meter's Microchip default `04D8:0001` USB IDs
(plus a fallback on the Product string `"LP-500"` / `"LP-700"`). If your
meter uses different IDs, edit `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-lp700.rules` and run
`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`.

## CI / releases

- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — `go vet`,
  `go test -race`, `go build` on every push and PR.
- [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) —
  runs on every push to `main`, i.e. every merged PR. It bumps the patch
  number of the highest `vX.Y.Z` tag, vets and tests, cross-compiles
  `linux/{amd64,arm64,armv7}` + `darwin/{amd64,arm64}` + `windows/amd64`,
  pushes the new tag, and publishes a GitHub Release with the binaries,
  `SHA256SUMS`, and notes auto-generated from the PRs since the previous
  tag. A failed test or build pushes no tag. The tag is stamped into each
  binary (`-ldflags "-X main.version=<tag>"`); `lp700-server -version`
  prints it.

For a minor or major bump, push the tag yourself; the tag push releases
that version and later merges continue from it:

```sh
git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0
```

## Configuration

`/etc/lp700-server/config.toml`:

| Field                     | Default          | Notes                                                              |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `meter.backend`           | `auto`           | `auto`, `hid`, `simulator`                                         |
| `meter.vendor_id`         | `0x04D8`         | Microchip default; 0 = match by Product string                     |
| `meter.product_id`        | `0x0001`         | PIC32 firmware default                                             |
| `meter.poll_ms`           | `40`             | 25 Hz; the meter pushes IN reports faster than we read them        |
| `server.listen`           | `0.0.0.0:8089`   | `:8089` to leave 8088 for `LP-100A-Server`                         |
| `server.allow_control`    | `true`           | Set `false` for a read-only port                                   |
| `server.max_clients`      | `32`             |                                                                    |
| `server.heartbeat_ms`     | `2000`           |                                                                    |
| `updates.check`           | `true`           | GitHub new-release check — see [Updates](#updates)                 |

After editing: `sudo systemctl restart lp700-server`.

### Logging

Defaults to **error** so the journal stays quiet. Two ways to turn it up:

- **At start time:** pass `-v` (debug). Edit `/etc/systemd/system/lp700-server.service`'s `ExecStart`.
- **At runtime, no restart:** open the web UI's **Setup** overlay and pick
  a level. Or hit the API directly:
  ```sh
  curl -s http://host:8089/api/log-level
  curl -s -XPOST http://host:8089/api/log-level -d '{"level":"debug"}'
  ```

## Updates

The server tells you when a newer LP-700-Server release is out. About a
minute after start, and then at most once a day while it runs, it makes
one anonymous request to GitHub —
`GET https://api.github.com/repos/VU3ESV/LP-700-Server/releases/latest` —
and compares the release tag with its own version (`vX.Y.Z` tuples; a
pre-release such as `v1.0.0-rc.1` sorts below `v1.0.0`, and a
`git describe` build such as `v0.2.1-3-g92ace11` sorts above the tag it
follows). A newer release is:

- shown as a notice at the top of the web UI —
  *"LP-700-Server vX.Y.Z is available (running …) — release notes"*;
- logged once per release (`journalctl -u lp700-server`), whatever the
  log level is set to;
- reported by `GET /api/update` (read-only JSON:
  `{enabled, automatic, current, update_available, latest, html_url, checked_at}`).

Nothing is downloaded or installed — update the usual way (release
binary, or `deploy/redeploy.sh`). The check runs on its own goroutine and
never touches the meter or the WebSocket clients. If GitHub can't be
reached it stays silent and tries again an hour later; the 24 h clock only
starts after a successful answer. Nothing is written to disk, so a
restart checks once more about a minute after start.

- **Turn it off:** `[updates] check = false` in `config.toml`, then
  restart the service. `deploy/redeploy.sh` keeps that setting when it
  regenerates `config.toml`.
- **Development builds** (a plain `go build` / `go run`, version `dev`)
  never check, and neither does a binary whose version has no `vX.Y.Z`
  core. `deploy/build-pi.sh` stamps `git describe --tags --match 'v[0-9]*'`,
  and the release workflow stamps the tag.
- **See the notice against the real latest release:** run with
  `LP700_SERVER_UPDATE_TEST_VERSION=0.0.1` set (ignored unless set); the
  first check comes a minute after start.

## Diagnostic subcommands

```sh
sudo /usr/local/bin/lp700-server probe -list                          # enumerate every HID
sudo /usr/local/bin/lp700-server probe -dump                          # live raw + decoded frames
sudo /usr/local/bin/lp700-server probe -capture out.bin -duration 5s  # capture for offline analysis
```

These never run the WS server — they're hardware-only.

## Security

**There is no authentication.** Anyone with network access to the listen
address can read telemetry and issue control commands. This is intentional
for LAN-only deployment. For remote access, front the server with Tailscale
or WireGuard and bind the listen address to the VPN interface (or
`127.0.0.1`).

**Browser origin check.** `/ws` refuses a WebSocket upgrade whose `Origin`
header names a different host:port than the request, so a web page on
another site can't use a browser on your LAN to drive the meter. The
embedded web client (same origin), native apps and Node-RED (no `Origin`)
are unaffected.

**Adding a login and TLS.** Set `listen = "127.0.0.1:8089"` and put a
reverse proxy (e.g. Caddy with `basicauth` + `tls`) on the LAN address. The
proxy must pass the original `Host` header through, which Caddy does by
default, or the origin check will refuse the browser client. Step by step,
with a tested Caddyfile, certificate requirements for Mac clients and
troubleshooting: [docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md](docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md).

Smoke test from the command line:

```sh
# requires websocat (brew install websocat)
websocat ws://raspberrypi.local:8089/ws
echo '{"type":"command","id":"1","action":"peak_toggle"}' | websocat ws://raspberrypi.local:8089/ws
```

## Web client

Mirrors the LP-500/700 **Power/SWR** screen — Avg power, Peak power, SWR,
channel pills (Auto / 1..4), range cycle, Peak/Avg/Tune buttons, alarm
enable/tripped indicator.

The Waveform/'Scope and Spectrum modes are *not* mirrored to the web UI
(the Mac client in [LP-700-App](https://github.com/VU3ESV/LP-700-App)
renders them); the `mode_step` verb (still accepted on `/ws`) cycles
the meter's on-LCD display so an operator can switch into them remotely
if needed. While the meter is on the waveform or spectrum LCD page, the
server emits `{"type":"scope"}` / `{"type":"spectrum"}` WebSocket
frames at ~4 Hz alongside the regular `telemetry` stream — each carries
a 320-element 8-bit array assembled from the firmware's cmd-`'1'`..`'5'`
segments (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) "Scope and spectrum sample
buffers" and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §4).

Numeric alarm thresholds, callsign, coupler model, and firmware
revision live in the meter's NVRAM and aren't transmitted via USB at
all (confirmed by USB pcap audit — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)) so
those rows are absent from the UI.

## Operations cheatsheet

```sh
journalctl -u lp700-server -f                                         # tail logs
sudo systemctl restart lp700-server                                   # after config change
sudo systemctl disable --now lp700-server                             # stop / disable
curl -sf http://localhost:8089/healthz && echo OK                     # health check
sudo -u lp700 /usr/local/bin/lp700-server -config /etc/lp700-server/config.toml -v
                                                                       # foreground debug run
curl -s -XPOST http://localhost:8089/api/log-level -d '{"level":"debug"}'
                                                                       # bump verbosity live
```

For Node-RED users coming from KD4Z's *LP-500/700 HID DIRECT* flow, see
[examples/node-red/](examples/node-red/) for a drop-in replacement that
talks to `/ws` instead of `/dev/hidraw*` (output `msg.payload` shape is
unchanged, so downstream nodes keep working).
